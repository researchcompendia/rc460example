This is a primitive example of how to package up code for a paper. It is so
primitive that it is just a bash script, seriously. that's primitive.

This is essentially what I packaged up as verification code for the [Text mining in computational
advertising](http://labs.researchcompendia.org/compendia/2/) labs page.
