============

This is what I packaged up as verification code for the [Text mining in computational
advertising](http://labs.researchcompendia.org/compendia/2/) labs page.

It is a primitive example of how to package up code for a paper. It is so
primitive that it is just a bash script, and manual steps are required for installing
dependencies. I manually installed lda, reshape, ggplot2 and their dependencies in to the site
library for all users at `/usr/local/lib/R/site-library/`.
